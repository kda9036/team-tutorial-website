                <p>CSS stands for “Cascading Style Sheets.”  It is a computer language that is used to style a web page.  CSS defines style rules to apply to different components of a web page.  It can adjust color, layout, fonts, and numerous other properties.  In other words, it is responsible for the presentation of a web page and making it snazzy! </p>
                <p>The goal of our website is to teach the basics of CSS so that users will have the tools necessary to start creating their own web pages that are stylish and appealing to their audience.  Our website can also serve as a resource for those looking to brush up on any prior CSS knowledge or those looking to reference the basic building blocks of CSS.</p>
