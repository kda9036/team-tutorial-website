<p>How do you target the components of a web page that need to be styled? CSS selectors!</p>
<p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS rule and tells the browser which HTML element(s) should be selected to receive the specified property values within the rule.</p>
<p>There are many CSS selectors and many combinations of CSS selectors that will allow specific HTML elements to be targeted, but the simplest are by type, id, and class.</p>

<h3>The Type (or Name) Selector</h3>
<p>Selects elements by tag name. Angle brackets are NOT used.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<!-- insert example here-->

<h3>ID Selector</h3>
<p>Selects a <i>single</i> element with a given id.</p>
<p>Steps: Create a unique id name, add it as an id attribute in an HTML tag for a single element, and write a style rule in CSS that starts with # followed by the id name.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>HTML:</p>
<!-- insert example here -->
<p>CSS:</p>
<!-- insert example here -->

<h3>Class Selector</h3>
<p>Selects all elements with a given class.</p>
<p>Steps: Create a class name, add it as a class attribute in HTML tags to one or more elements, and write a style rule in CSS that starts with a period (.) followed by the class name.</p>
<p>For Example,</p>
<p>HTML:</p>
<!-- insert example here -->
<p>CSS:</p>
<!-- insert example here -->

<h3>Using Multiple Selectors & Grouping</h3>
<p>CSS selectors can be grouped or combined to create more specific selections. Some of the most common methods will be addressed.</p>
<p>Grouping CSS Selectors:</p>
<p>Commas can be used to select multiple elements.</p>
<p>For Example,</p>
<!-- insert example here -->

<h3>Descendant Selector</h3>
<p>A space can be used to target all elements that are descendants of a specified element.</p>
<p>For Example,</p>
<!-- insert example here -->

<h3>Element.class</h3>
<p>A period can be used to select all elements with a particular class name.</p>
<p>For Example,</p>
<!-- insert example here -->

<h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
<p>There are certain rules to follow when creating ids and class names.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Must begin with a letter A-Z or a-z</li>
    <li>Can be followed by: letters (A-Za-z), digits (0-9), hyphens ("-"), and underscores ("_")</li>
    <li>camelCase: not mandatory, but instead of using hyphens or underscores for combining words, the first letter of each word is capitalized, except for the first word</li>
</ul>
